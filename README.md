1- Detects available Wi-Fi interfaces and lets the user select one.

2- Scans for available GPS devices and prompts the user to choose one.

3- Collects Wi-Fi SSID and signal strength data.

4- Retrieves GPS coordinates from the selected device.

5- Associates Wi-Fi scan results with GPS coordinates.
